# Covid19-EDA
A descriptive analysis on reported covid cases around the world.
# Objective (problem statement)
The purpose of this project is to give a visual of the reported confirmed cases around the world. To know where covid19 cases are prevalent, to know thw increase rate over the 3 year span from 2020 to 2022.

# Data Sourcing
I scraped this covid data from the web using excel. The source of the data is from The Oyinbooke's github page: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

# Data Cleaning
I didn't need to clean the data because it was relatively good to use as it was. I however had to bring out a separate month, year and day coumn from he original date column.

# Findings
I found out that the United States is the country/region with the most confirmed covid cases and that North is the country with the least covid cases. 
Also, the covid cases increase with the years.
